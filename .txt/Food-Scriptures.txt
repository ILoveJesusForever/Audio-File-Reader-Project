Scriptures About Spiritual Food,

John Chapter 4, Verses 31-38,
In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”

But He said to them, “I have food to eat of which you do not know.”

Therefore the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?”

Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work. 
Do you not say, ‘There are still four months and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest! 
And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. 
For in this the saying is true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’ 
I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.”

Ezekiel Chapter 2, Verses 1-8,

“Stand up, son of man,” said the voice. “I want to speak with you.” 
The Spirit came into me as he spoke, and he set me on my feet. I listened carefully to his words. 
“Son of man,” he said, “I am sending you to the nation of Israel, a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have been rebelling against me to this very day. 
They are a stubborn and hard-hearted people. But I am sending you to say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says!’ 
And whether they listen or refuse to listen—for remember, they are rebels—at least they will know they have had a prophet among them.

“Son of man, do not fear them or their words. Don’t be afraid even though their threats surround you like nettles and briers and stinging scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls, even though they are rebels. 
You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. But they won’t listen, for they are completely rebellious! 
Son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not join them in their rebellion. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you.”
